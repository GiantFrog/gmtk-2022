I think he’s an actor. So cool!","Has nobody else noticed that the rock over there has eyes?","I still miss her, but I’m glad she was able to pull off that whole birch stunt. Seeing her around makes me feel a bit more safe.","Hey! Have you heard? We get to DO stuff in the next update!","Heard they ran out of budget just before launch… rough.","Increasing your maximum HP does not heal you for that amount.","When in the enchanting menu, you can hold Shift then type the letter of the Glyph and I’ll tell you what I know about it!","Some Glyphs get stronger the more they are used, and the bonuses persist between games of Die Fighting.","There’s no penalty for losing a game of Die Fighting","Block glyphs prevent incoming damage from the opponent’s next turn.","Physically weighting your Die is illegal. But enchanting it so that one side is heavier is okay. Make it make sense!","I think I went on a date with one of those imps in high school. But I can’t remember if it was Scrungle or Scraggy.","I’m gonna say it! I don’t think a hut with chicken legs is that scary. But Baba Yaga herself is pretty nasty.","I’m glad you kept around that spellbook with all your glyphs from your days when you did this professionally. Even if it has some painful memories, it has certainly come in handy today.","Do you think the mice will rise as vampiric thralls? They look pretty dead to me…","I used all the confetti making a cake last week, that’s why the glyph doesn’t do anything. Sorry.","Be careful with those Blood Sacrifice Glyphs, the payout is huge but I hate seeing you hurt yourself.","I suppose a Blood Mortgage would come from a blood bank, wouldn’t it. Popular with vampires, I’m told.","Don’t forget that you always start a game of Die Fighting at full health."};
